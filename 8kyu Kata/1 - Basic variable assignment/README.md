## *Welcome to my Codewars Solutions!*

### The language I am training in is **Javascript**.

I'm currently now on 7kyu katas, but I'm still training in 8kyu to get back into the swing of things as I took a long break away from the keyboard. Even though I've been doing these challenges for some time, I've made the decision to log my solutions here to look back at them and see my progress.

I would love to see other solutions and to discuss different ways of solving certain problems!
